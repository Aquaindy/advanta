"""Fee collection layer.

Rolls a workspace's ACCRUED fee ledger into an invoice through a pluggable
PaymentProvider, flips those accruals to INVOICED, and records a FeeInvoice. The
ledger stays processor-agnostic — swapping Stripe/Paddle/manual touches only the
provider passed here. Re-running never double-bills: only ACCRUED rows are
picked up, and they leave the pool the moment they're invoiced."""
