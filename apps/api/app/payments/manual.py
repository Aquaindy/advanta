"""Manual / off-platform invoice provider.

The zero-config default: it records the bill as an OPEN invoice without touching
a payment processor. Use it to collect fees by wire/ACH/manual payment link, or
as the always-available fallback so fees are billed even before a processor is
wired up. Reconcile by marking the invoice paid once funds arrive."""
