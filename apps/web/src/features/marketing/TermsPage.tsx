          Last updated: {new Date().toLocaleDateString("en-US", { year: "numeric", month: "long", day: "numeric" })}
        </p>

        <Section title="1. Acceptance">
          <p>
            By creating an AdVanta account or workspace you agree to these
            Terms. If you're using AdVanta on behalf of a company, you
            represent that you have authority to bind that company.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="2. Your data + connected accounts">
          <p>
            You authorize AdVanta to read and (where you've explicitly
            approved) write to ad accounts, analytics platforms, and websites
            you connect via OAuth. Tokens are encrypted at rest and used
            only to perform the actions you approve.
          </p>
          <p>
            You retain full ownership of all content, recommendations, and
            metrics produced in your workspace. You can disconnect any
            integration or delete your workspace at any time.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="3. Approvals + Autopilot">
          <p>
            Sensitive actions (campaign launches, budget changes, audience
            edits) require explicit approval. Autopilot Mode, when enabled,
            executes within rules you set and can be disabled at any time.
            AdVanta is not liable for ad spend incurred via approved
            actions.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="4. Acceptable use">
          <p>
            Don't use AdVanta to send unsolicited spam, run misleading ad
            campaigns, infringe third-party rights, or violate the terms of
            connected platforms (Google, Meta, LinkedIn, etc.). Outreach
            emails sent via AdVanta must include an unsubscribe path —
            we add one automatically.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="5. Billing">
          <p>
            Paid plans are billed monthly or annually via Paddle. Plan limits are
            enforced on a 30-day rolling window. Past-due subscriptions
            revert to the free tier until payment resolves. Refunds are
            handled case-by-case.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="6. Termination">
          <p>
            You can delete your workspace at any time. We may suspend
            accounts that violate these Terms, with notice when feasible.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="7. Liability">
          <p>
            AdVanta is provided "as is." Our aggregate liability for any
            claim is limited to the fees you paid in the 12 months
            preceding the event giving rise to the claim.
          </p>
        </Section>
